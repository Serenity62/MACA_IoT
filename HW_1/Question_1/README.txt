Homework 1 Question 1

Introduction

In Homework 1 Question 1 there are three parts. Part one creates two hybrid images using the magnitude of one image and the phase of the another image. The second part of Question 1 creates an image that neutralizes the magnitude components of the images while displaying the phase components. While part three of Question 1 creates an image that displays the magnitude components of the image and removes the phase components. 

Requirements

This project requires access to Matlab 2017a along with three different images with a .bmp extension to use for hybrids.

Usage

To use this project to input the images you want to use just go to the line in which the code uses the functions rgb2gray(imread()) and replace what is inside of the imread() function with the correct directory to your desired images. The easiest way to to this is to save the images in the same folder you matlab file is saved in and just type the images as seen in the files currently. Once the desired images are inside the function, uncomment the imshow() functions at the bottom of the files and run the code.
